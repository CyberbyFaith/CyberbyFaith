### Operation: Defend the North – Module: Pharmacy Cyberattack Crisis ###

## Scenario: When Cyberattacks Threaten Healthcare — A Pharmacy Crisis Unfolds ##
# Company: Appointment 2 # 

***📌 Overview***

Appointment 2 is a medium-sized pharmacy and drugstore operating three locations across a town of ~150,000 residents. They are the only pharmacy service provider, making them a critical part of the community’s healthcare infrastructure.

During this scenario, the pharmacy faces a major cyber incident that halts payment processing and interferes with critical financial and prescription data. This threatens patient safety, revenue, and public trust.

***📰 News Report Summary***

A cyber incident has halted prescription refills and essential purchases. Pharmacies cannot process transactions, access reporting data, or confirm medication inventory — putting patients’ health at immediate risk. What began as a financial outage has escalated into a full healthcare service disruption.
