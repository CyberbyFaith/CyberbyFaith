CyberSecurity Analysis | Penetration Tester | Offensive Security

I am a dedicated cybersecurity student with a strong foundation in IT and a passion for offensive security. Through hands-on labs and training, Iâ€™ve gained experience simulating real-world attack scenarios and working through the penetration testing lifecycle. I enjoy analyzing and breaking down systems, thinking like an attacker, and building the mindset of a red team professional. Recently, I earned the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) certification (September 2025) and am currently completing my Cybersecurity Diploma at ABM College, expected (December 2025).

I have expertise in technical hardware, software, and network troubleshooting, as well as network architecture and data analytics, with a strong focus on offensive security. My experience includes using SIEM and IDS/IPS tools to understand system behaviors, configuring and hardening systems, managing Active Directory, and administering Linux environments. I am proficient in scripting and programming with Python and SQL to automate tasks, exploit vulnerabilities, and develop penetration testing tools. I am familiar with cybersecurity frameworks such as NIST and ISO/IEC 27001, and security standards and regulations including HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and GDPR. I thrive on analyzing complex systems, thinking like an attacker, and uncovering security weaknesses before they can be exploited.
