CyberSecurity Analysis | Penetration Tester | Offensive Security

I am a dedicated cybersecurity student with a strong foundation in IT and a passion for offensive security. Recently, I earned the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) certification (September 2025) and am currently completing my Cybersecurity Diploma at ABM College, expected December 2025. My focus lies in developing hands-on expertise in penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and network defense, while continuously building on my technical knowledge and practical skills.
